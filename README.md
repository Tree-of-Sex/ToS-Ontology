# Tree of Sex ontology

The Tree of Sex Ontology (TOSO) covers any trait related to reproduction included in the Tree of Sex database and will be constructed by the members of the Tree of Sex [initiative](https://treeofsex.sanger.ac.uk/) 


# General Introduction
'[July 2024]'

This initial version of ToS Ontology aims to create a minimal ontology that could capture the [first instance of the ToS database](http://treeofsex.org/); This ontology will be the proof of concept and an example to define and refine the workflow of the TOSO contributors. 

ToS Ontology will be an “_application ontology_”, meaning it will aim to reuse as many terms of other ontologies in it; Only terms that are not suitably defined elsewhere, will be added with a definition. 

Primarily we would like the terms to be sourced from OBO Foundry ontologies - the starting place to look is [PATO](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/pato.html), [GO]() and then expand with other selected [OBO Foundry ontologies](https://obofoundry.org/).
